# Recycling Pioneers ESP32 Logic Files

Project underway by Recycling Pioneers with Buildings and Grounds of McGill University. 

This repository includes all the logic for the ESP32 modules that will be used for the smart bins around the Downtown McGill Campus. All sensitive information incluing database keys
and WiFi information is hidden for security reasons.

1) ESP32_Calibration: Logic to help calibrate the scale when installing.
2) ESP32_Logic_W_Intervals: Logic for bins that will read data every 30 min. 
3) ESP32_Realtime_logic: Logic needed for bins that will be using realtime data.
