# Recycling Pioneers ESP32 Logic Files

Project underway by Recycling Pioneers with Buildings and Grounds of McGill University. 

This repository includes all the logic for the ESP32 modules that will be used for the smart bins around the Downtown McGill Campus. All sensitive information incluing database keys
and WiFi information is hidden for security reasons.

Please contact Arneet Kalra for any information. 

## Files Included

1) ESP32_Calibration: Logic to help calibrate the scale when installing.
2) ESP32_Logic_W_Intervals: Logic for bins that will read data every 30 min. 
3) ESP32_Realtime_logic: Logic needed for bins that will be using realtime data.

## Where the project is at:
The final touches are currently being put for the low-level software. By August 3rd 2020, it will be complete. Then Recycling Pioneer's focus will shift towards developing the official Recycling Pioneer website, where all the data will be presented via the Firebase Realtime Database.
